## Brief Description
The objective of the game is to guide the moving 'Snake' towards the 'Food' placed over random positions in a bounded area. The bounded area is considered as 'Wall'. While guiding the 'Snake', the player has to make the 'Snake' avoid 3 things to continue the game and earn points:

- Touch the 'Wall'  
- Touch the 'Obstacle'  
- Touch itself 

Failing to maintain these will cause the game as ended.
The top three high scores of each level will be displayed in the scorecard from all the scores.
