###### Brief Description
The objective of the game is to guide the moving 'Snake' towards the 'Food' placed over random positions in a bounded area. The bounded area is considered as 'wall'. While guiding the 'Snake', the player has to make the 'Snake' avoid 3 things to continue the game and earn points:

- touch the 'Wall'  
- touch the 'obstacle'  
- touch the body of the 'Snake' itself 

Failing to maintain these will cause the game as ended.
The game has three level of dificulty for playing- Easy, Medium and Hard. The first three high score are kept as record and can be seen from Scoreboard option from the "main menu".
